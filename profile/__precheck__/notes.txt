Development Machine Profile

=== Pre-Installation

Ensure you setup a JumpCloud account prior to using this profile.
Retrieve your connect key from the admin console (go to add machine to reveal the value.)

If you are OSX Mojave, please sign into the App Store on your new Mac, to facilitate
installing the App Store applications.

This profile requires the presence of a disk volume configured as described in:
profile/vars/external_disk.yml   Mount this volume and ensure the mount point is configured
as the PATCH_DISK environment variable.

This profile requires a shared disk volume for applications that are used on multiple boot
partitions.  Mount this volume and ensure this partition's mount point is accurately set
as the SHARED_DISK environment variable.

If you have encrypted disks that you don't wish to mount during startup find their UUIDS:
$ diskutil info DiskName | grep 'Volume UUID:' | cut -d':' -f2 | awk '{print$1}'
Create a comma separated list and set the IGNORE_UUID environment variable.

=== Post-Installation

Once installation is completed you should see the machine reporting in the admin console.
You can now apply any configured policies you have created.

Make sure to enable disk encryption centrally, on whatever machine group you add your Mac too.
(On Big Sur systems you'll need to enroll the machine in MDM.)

Development Machine Profile

=== Pre-Installation

This profile requires the presence of a disk volume configured as described in:
profile/vars/external_disk.yml   Mount this volume and ensure the mount point is configured
as the PATCH_DISK environment variable.

If you have encrypted disks that you don't wish to mount during startup find their UUIDS:
$ diskutil info DiskName | grep 'Volume UUID:' | cut -d':' -f2 | awk '{print$1}'
Create a comma separated list and set the IGNORE_UUID environment variable.

=== Post-Installation

Start LaunchControl and install 'fdautil'.  When prompted be sure to enable Full Disk Access.
This will enable Full Disk Access for ClamAV.

Enable File Vault.
